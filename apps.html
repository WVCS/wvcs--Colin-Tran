    <p> On this page, we'll look through each of the apps that we had to create throughout the year. </p>

      <h2> Food Delivery </h2>
      <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/486820892/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> This app was actually the first ever project we had in computer science and it was made with scratch. What this needed was some sort of user interaction with the app itself. The app 
      depicts a food delivery worker who needs your help to deliver some food. You have to click on the right foods to deliver and go with the delivery person to the park to give the food out.
      It is a really simple and easy app that was the 1st ever coding assignment we did. </p>

    <h2> App Project - Most Played Games</h2>
    <iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/gk6oiVlvc4jOjTf7a0YYLRgmBxe84r_KLxT3kXiDNss/embed"></iframe>
    <p> This was the first app I made with code.org. It had to have feature several different pages along with an easy way to navigate between these different screens. I decided that this 
    app specifically would deal with video games since that is a passion of mine. I would present the user base with different genre types for games and their respective popularities. </p>

      <h2> Burger Store - Buy the Ingredients! </h2>
      <iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/QqoeS5DPLRE_OhXkYSQiTP7erZZ3VOmTpcn6tzX86BU/embed"></iframe>
      <p> This app was our next major coding assignment//project. Our goal was to create an app that utilize conditionals. For my app I decided I wanted to have an interactive app that 
        could simulate a real-world experience. This real-world experience I ended up choosing to be a restaurant worker. You would need to go to the grocery store to buy ingredients
        because the restaurant has run out. However, be sure to pick the right ingredients or you would fail and need to restart. </p>

      <h2> Dataset App - Covid Country Checker </h3>
      <iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/VfPQHXqJFTmA7TsNWuCDI1UQBksRUnrpXrSTyyYMmfg/embed"></iframe>
      <p> This was our final app that we eneded up creating for the class. The objective of this app was to incorporate a dataset table into our app using our previous knowledge. 
        For this app, I was having a hard time deciding on a theme/idea. Once I looked at the possibilites for data however, I ended up choosing an app that could output 
        the countries around the world and their associated amount of COVID-19 cases. </p>
