    <h2> App Project - Most Played Games</h2>

    <p> This was the first app I made with code.org. It had to have feature several different pages along with an easy way to navigate between these different screens. I decided that this 
    app specifically would deal with video games since that is a passion of mine. I would present the user base with different genre types for games and their respective popularities. </p>
