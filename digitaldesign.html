    <h2> Net Neutrality Flyer </h2>

      <p> This was a flyer that we had to design in class about what net neutrality was and what my own opinion is on it. It was a small infographic that would hopefully
        persuade and inform. </p>

      <p> This was our group digital design which me and my friends contributed to. We decided to make a night skyline of a city and I ended up doing the stars for this specific
        project. </p>
